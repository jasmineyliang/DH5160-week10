## Introduction to U.S. County Health Rankings with Tableau
Welcome to our next exploration in the AI and Analytics class! This week, we’ll dive into the U.S. County Health Rankings dataset using Tableau. This dataset provides a wealth of information about various health factors and outcomes across U.S. counties. By analyzing this data, you’ll gain insights into how different factors like education, employment, and access to healthcare impact the overall health of a community.

**Your Task:**
You will use Tableau to create visualizations that explore key health indicators across U.S. counties. By the end of this assignment, you should have a better understanding of how to leverage Tableau for public health data analysis.

# Assignment: Comparative Analysis of Health Disparities

## Objective
Use Tableau to compare health disparities across different regions and demographics within the U.S. County Health Rankings dataset. The goal is to identify and visualize these disparities and propose potential strategies to address them.

## Assignment Steps

## Instructions
Dataset
- **Dataset**: [U.S. County Health Rankings](https://public.tableau.com/app/sample-data/County_Health_Rankings.csv)
  
**Download and Prepare the Dataset:**
   - Download the dataset from the [U.S. County Health Rankings](https://public.tableau.com/app/sample-data/County_Health_Rankings.csv) link.
   - Open Tableau Public and connect to the CSV file.

**Data Exploration and Connection:**
   - **Connect to Data:** Import the CSV file into Tableau.
   - **Explore the Dataset:** Familiarize yourself with the data fields, such as county names, health metrics (e.g., premature death, poor physical health days, etc.), and geographic information.


### 1. Select Health Indicators
- **Choose at least three health indicators** from the dataset (e.g., obesity rates, access to healthcare, physical inactivity).
- Consider selecting indicators that may be influenced by socioeconomic factors or access to resources.

### 2. Data Segmentation
- **Segment by Demographics:** Divide the data based on demographic factors like age, income, or education level.
- **Segment by Region:** Compare health outcomes across different regions (e.g., urban vs. rural, state-by-state comparisons).

### 3. Create Visualizations
- **Demographic Disparity Chart:** Create visualizations that highlight disparities in health outcomes based on demographic factors. For example, compare obesity rates between different income levels or education levels.
- **Regional Comparison Map:** Build a map that visually compares the selected health indicators across different regions or states.
- **Overlay Analysis:** Create a dual-axis chart or overlay analysis to show how multiple health indicators correlate with each other across regions or demographics.

### 4. Insights and Strategy Development
- Write a report (1-2 pages) discussing the disparities you discovered. Focus on specific regions or demographic groups that are particularly affected.
- **Suggest strategies** or public health interventions that could help reduce these disparities. Provide evidence or reasoning to support your suggestions.

### 5. Submission
- Upload your Tableau workbook and the report to the repo.
- Ensure your visualizations are clear and effectively communicate the disparities identified.

By completing this assignment, you’ll develop a deeper understanding of how to use Tableau to analyze health data and propose actionable strategies based on your findings. This will complement the broader skills you’ll develop in the mini-project.





## Mini Project: Exploring U.S. County Health Rankings with Tableau

## Objective
